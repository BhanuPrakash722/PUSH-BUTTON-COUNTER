# DESCRIPTION
This project involves designing a microcontroller-based system using an Arduino Uno to perform two main functions: count button presses and measure temperature using a DHT11 sensor. The results are displayed on a serial monitor via the I2C interface. This system is highly versatile, combining basic input counting with real-time environmental data monitoring.
